# MIPS
Implementation of two solutions for the MIPS architecture. One of them without pipeline and the other one with pipeline.

These solutions can be found in the following references:
 - Patterson, David A., and John L. Hennessy. "Computer organization and design: the hardware/software interface 5th ed." (2014).
